    - *Contribution Submission*: Banks submit their individual contributions via the API.
    - *Commitment Posting*: Banks compute and post cryptographic commitments to the bulletin board.
    - *Share Distribution*: Contributions are split into shares, and each bank distributes its share to others.
    - *ZKP Verification*: The protocol checks the validity of the commitments using ZKPs.
    - *Round-Robin Communication*: Banks exchange shares in a round-robin fashion.
    - *Aggregation*: The shares are aggregated, and the final result is computed.
